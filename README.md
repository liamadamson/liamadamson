### Hey, I'm Liam Adamson 👋

I'm a software developer currently living in London 🇬🇧

By day, I'm writing software for embedded systems at Engie ⚡ (primarily using Rust 🦀, but sometimes in C, C++, or Python 🐍).
By night, when I get the time, I love to tinker around with different things - from web development 🌍 to control systems.

Feel free to reach out to me through [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-adamson-2b8b0a151/) or [email me](mailto:liamadamson1996@gmail.com)!
